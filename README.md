# Palace
 Simple local multiplayer console-based board game
## Self-assesment
Design a complete program from beginning to end:4__
Demonstrate coding successfully a complete working program:4__
The program needs to be sufficiently complex:4__
Program should be robust to handle all sorts of user and programmer errors:4__
1)To get the logic of the game 100% on point, there are so many little things that could be slightly different from actual physical gameplay__
2)Everything else was simple to do__
3)Table class took longer to debug and write,the rest was pretty much on point if not shorter__
4)Very similar with an extra class(player) and the Ai class is used inside the Table class but not the main class__
5)I'd love to be able to improve the design of play method in the table class. It could have been shorter and more modular__
6)It was fun to do
